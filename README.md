# databases_-and_-SQL_python
Jupyter/IPython notebooks can be used for an interactive data analysis with SQL on a relational database. This fuses together the advantages of using Jupyter, a well-established platform for data analysis, with the ease of use of SQL and the performance of SQL engines.

Jupyter magic functions allow you to replace a boilerplate code snippets with more concise one. Letâ€™s explore Jupyter SQL magic that allows us to interact with Presto or any other relational databases.

Objectives:

  Describe concepts related to accessing Databases using Python
  Learn and Practice how to connect to a database from a Jupyter notebook
  How to create tables and insert data from Python
  Write SQL queries and retrieve result sets from Python
  Practice how to perform simplified database access from Python using SQL magic
  Enumerate different type of JOIN operations
  INNER JOIN and practice hands-on
  Distinguish between different types of OUTER JOINs
  Effective use of formulating SQL queries
  Use of invoking SQL queries from Jupyter notebooks using Python
